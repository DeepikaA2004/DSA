## PROBLEM STATEMENTS
1. **Reverse a string:** Write a function to reverse the characters in a given string.
2. **Check for palindrome:** Write a function to check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).
3. **Find the length of a string:** Write a function to count and return the number of characters in a string.
4. **Find the first or last occurrence of a character:** Write functions to find the index of a specified character's first or last occurrence within a string.
5. **Convert case:** Write functions to convert a string to all uppercase or all lowercase characters.
6. **Remove extra spaces:** Write a function to remove leading, trailing, and duplicate spaces from a string.
7. **Split a string:** Write a function to split a string into a list of words based on a given delimiter (e.g., space, comma, etc.).
8. **Join a list of strings:** Write a function to join a list of strings into a single, concatenated string with a specified separator.
9. **Check for substring:** Write a function to check if a given substring exists within a larger string.
10. **Replace a substring:** Write a function to replace all occurrences of a specified substring within a string with another string.
11. **Reverse each word in a sentence:** Write a function to reverse the order of characters within each sentence, while preserving word order.   
12. **Remove duplicates from a string:** Write a function to remove all duplicate characters from a string, keeping only the first occurrence of each character.
13. **Check for anagrams:** Write a function to check if two strings are anagrams of each other (contain the same letters in different arrangements).
14. **Find the most frequent character:** Write a function to find the character that appears most frequently in a string.
15. **Check for repeating characters:** Write a function to check if a string has any repeated characters consecutively.
 		
  16.  ### STACK 
		 1. Check for Empty: Write a function to determine if a stack is empty.
		 2. Peek: Write a function to return the top element of a stack without
		    removing it.
		 3. Push: Write a function to add an element to the top of a stack.
		 4. Pop: Write a function to remove and return the top element of a stack.
	         5. Get Size: Write a function to return the number of elements in a stack.
	         6. Implement a Stack: Create a stack data structure using an array or linked
		    list.
	         7. Reverse a String: Use a stack to reverse the characters of a given string.
 	         8. Balanced Parentheses: Check if a string of parentheses is balanced (e.g.,
                    (())" is balanced, ")(())" is not).
  
  17.   ###  QUEUE 
       
		 9. Check for Empty: Write a function to determine if a queue is empty.
	        10. Enqueue: Write a function to add an element to the rear of a queue.
	        11. Dequeue: Write a function to remove and return the element at the front
		     of a queue.
	        12. Peek: Write a function to return the element at the front of a queue
		     without removing it.
	        13. Get Size: Write a function to return the number of elements in a queue.
	        14. Implement a Queue: Create a queue data structure using an array or linked
		      list.
                15. Reverse a Queue: Reverse the elements of a given queue.
